# Exercise Printing

# Create a program that print values

# Print a integer value
# Print a float value
# Print a String
# Print a boolean value
# Print a None value
# Print a f-string containing all previous values in one line i.e 1, 1.0, "hello" ..

a = 5
print(f'a is of type {type(a)}and with a value of {a}')

b = 2.5
print(f'b is of type {type(b)} and with a value of {a}')

c = "Det är fint väder ute!"

print(f'c is of type {type(c)}and with a value of {c}')

e = False

print(f'e is of type {type(e)} and with a value of {e}')

f = None

print(f'f is of type {type(f)}and with a value of {f}')

print(f'{a},{b},{c},{e},{f}')
