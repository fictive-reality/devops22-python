# Use the deque FIFO, first in, first out. I.e if ["lisa", "olle", "pelle"] is in the list, t
# hen use pop left so that "lisa" is first to leave the queue.

# 1. Generate a list with 50 names
# 2. Create a Queue `deque` with a maximum length of 10
# 3. Let random number of person leave the queue
# 4. When the random number of persons has left the queue, fill the missing spots
# 5. Iterate until all 50 has gone through the queue
