# `Exercise 1` Dataset

# Todays exercises requires that you generate test data. You can generate data in multiple ways i.e 
# manually through loops, using `random` module or list comprehension. See examples in `8_data.py`.

# 1. Generate a list containing the numbers 1, 2, 3 to 100.
# 2. Generate a list of all even numbers from 2 to 60
# 3. Generate a list of all odd numbers from 1 to 77
# 4. Generate a list of 100 numbers between 1 - 300
#     1. The numbers must be unique
#     2. The numbers are selected randomly (not unique)
# 5. create a list containing five colors (not containing red)
#    1. Create a new list containing "red" and also add two colors by random with `choice`, `choices` or `sample` from the list.
#    2. Generate a list of random colors from the list of 3, the list should be of length 50.
#    3. Print the length of all three lists and the unique colors in each list
