# `Exercise 5` Named tuple

# 1. Create a named tuple with the coordinates (x, y)
# 2. Create two points
# 3. Print the points in a board i.e

#     ```Python
#     # Generate a board
#     board = [["-"]*10 for i in range(10)]

#     # Print board
#     for row in board:
#         print(row)

#     # mark x, y in board as *
#     board[1][2] = '*'
#     board[4][6] = '*'
#   '''
# 4. Calculate the Euclidean distance (hypotenuse) for Point1 and Point2, i.e (1, 2) and (4, 6) has the distance 5.
